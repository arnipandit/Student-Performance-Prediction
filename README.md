ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analysis Using Data Science ðŸŽ“

In this project, I explored the influence of various socio-demographic and academic factors on studentsâ€™ performance using a publicly available dataset. Leveraging tools such as Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualized key insights, and built predictive models to better understand what drives academic success.

#Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student performance data.
Visualize trends and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Identify key variables that impact academic results.
Build and evaluate classification models for performance prediction.

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization
Scikit-learn for modeling
Jupyter Notebook

# Key Insights
Relationships between parental education, test preparation, and student scores.

Gender-based and ethnic group trends in subject performance.

Importance of feature selection in model accuracy.

This project demonstrates the power of data science in educational analytics and provides insights that can inform policy-making and personalized learning strategies.
